This module is a Ferite binding to the MHash library. If your OS doesn't have a
standard package for the MHash library, you can obtain it from:
http://mhash.sourceforge.net/

At the time of writing, the supported hash algorithms include:
CRC32, MD5, SHA1, HAVAL256, RIPEMD160, TIGER, GOST, CRC32B, HAVAL224, HAVAL192,
HAVAL160, HAVAL128, TIGER128, TIGER160, MD4, and SHA256.

Because the MHash module obtains the list of algorithms dynamically, if you
upgrade the MHash library to one which includes a new hash algorithm, the
MHash module will automatically support it.`

See the mhash library manual page and MHash/MHash.fec for more documentation.

The MHash module was written by Alex Holden <alex@alexholden.net>.
