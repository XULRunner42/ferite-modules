This is a Ferite serial interface module. Currently it only supports BSD
termios but the API is designed to be generic enough to support other serial
port systems without needing to change the API too dramatically.

This module was written by Alex Holden <alex@alexholden.net>.
It is distributed under the same license as Ferite itself, ie. the BSD license.
