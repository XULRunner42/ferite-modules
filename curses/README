This is a Ferite binding to the standard Unix Curses terminal interface library.
It has currently only been tested with the ncurses library, but I have tried to
avoid non-portable features so it should hopefully work with little or no
modification on other flavours of Curses.

The binding supports most of the commonly used features of Curses, but does not
implement support for the printw and scanw functions, or various rarely used
features such as dumping windows and screens to files, or opening multiple
terminals. It also doesn't provide any of the ncurses extensions.

Note to Curses newbies: If many of the functions seem oddly named, or if it
seems strange that the same functionality often overlaps several different
functions, it is because I have tried to stay fairly faithful to the actual C
Curses library. After getting used to the Ferite Curses binding it should not
be too painful for you to learn to use the C Curses library directly. The main
difference is that the Ferite bindings simplify the API by cutting down as
much as possible on the many functions which do slight variations on the
same thing.

Note to Curses experts: Most of the functions which don't specify a window (and
hence operate on the root window) aren't available- you instead need to call
the desired method on the root window object you obtained from the Curses.init()
function. When you previously would have used different functions for moving
the cursor or not moving the cursor before an operation, you now use the same
method for both and either specify or don't specify the coordinates to move to.
The Curses coordinate and dimension argument order (h, w, y, x) has been
reversed to the much more common (x, y, w, h) arrangement.
