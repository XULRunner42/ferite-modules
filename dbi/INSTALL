To install this package you need to follow three steps:

	1) Run ./configure
	2) Run make
	3) Run make install
	
The install will cause the ferite documentation to be regenerated including 
the newly installed module. Any examples will be copied to the ferite examples 
directory.

With the dbi module the configure script can take a number of extra
options to allow the location of libdbi to be in a non standard location.
These are:

	--with-libdbi-libdir=
	--with-libdbi-incdir=

They allow you to specify the library and header locations within your
system.
